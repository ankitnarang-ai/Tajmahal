                <p>The Taj Mahal (lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of
                    the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal
                    emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also
                    houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)
                    complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three
                    sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
                <p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases
                    of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its
                    entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, which in 2020 would be
                    approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000
                    artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court
                    architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect natural beauty and
                    divinity.</p>

                <p>The Taj Mahal is built on a parcel of land to the south of the walled city of Agra. Shah Jahan
                    presented Maharaja Jai Singh I with a large palace in the centre of Agra in exchange for the land.
                    An area of roughly 1.2 hectares (3 acres) was excavated, filled with dirt to reduce seepage, and
                    levelled at 50 metres (160 ft) above the riverbank level. In the tomb area, piles were dug and
                    filled with stone and rubble to form the footings of the tomb. Instead of lashed bamboo, workmen
                    constructed a colossal brick</p>

                        favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal.</li>
                    <li><span class="fact-title">Fact 2:</span> The Taj Mahal's color changes constantly throughout the
                        day.</li>
                    <li><span class="fact-title">Fact 3:</span> Jahan's grave breaks the perfect symmetry of the Taj
                        Mahal.The placing of the cenotaph of Shah Jahan — and his grave — are perhaps the only elements
                        of the Taj that do not follow perfect geometric proportions and symmetrical precision.
                        .</li>
                    <li><span class="fact-title">Fact 4:</span> The four minarets, or towers, of the Taj, lean slightly
                        outwards, thereby making the Taj Mahal look much larger from a distance. Because of this optical
                        illusion, the first view that visitors are treated to upon entering the main gate is a striking
                        one.
